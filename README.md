## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the amount of solar energy generated by solar panels based on various environmental factors. Accurate solar power prediction is crucial for efficient grid management, energy trading, and optimizing the integration of renewable energy sources.

By analyzing historical weather data and solar generation metrics, this model forecasts potential energy output, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

### 🎯 Key Objectives
* Analyze the correlation between weather parameters (temperature, humidity, cloud cover, etc.) and power generation.
* Build and compare regression models to predict energy output.
* Deploy the model for real-time or batch prediction.

## 📂 Dataset
* **Source:** [Insert Link to Dataset, e.g., Kaggle, NASA Power, or Private Data]
* **Description:** The dataset contains time-series data including:
    * **Timestamp:** Date and time of observation.
    * **Temperature:** Ambient temperature ($^\circ C$).
    * **Irradiance:** Solar radiation hitting the panel ($W/m^2$).
    * **Humidity:** Relative humidity (%).
    * **Wind Speed:** Wind velocity ($m/s$).
    * **Power Output (Target):** Energy generated ($kW$ or $MW$).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Frameworks:** TensorFlow/Keras (if applicable), XGBoost, Streamlit
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Git

## 📊 Methodology
1.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Handling missing values and outliers.
    * Feature engineering (e.g., extracting hour/month from timestamps).
    * Normalization/Scaling of numerical features.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Visualizing relationships between weather variables and power output.
    * Time-series decomposition (Trend, Seasonality).
3.  **Model Selection:**
    * Tested multiple algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM.
4.  **Evaluation:**
    * Metrics used: RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and $R^2$ Score.

## 📈 Model Performance
* **Best Model:** [e.g., Random Forest Regressor]
* **R² Score:** [e.g., 0.92]
* **MAE:** [e.g., 15.5 kW]

> *Note: The Random Forest model demonstrated the best ability to handle non-linear relationships between cloud cover and irradiance.*
